# Decreen

Decreen helps teams understand and navigate complex systems by deriving structured maps from existing artifacts (docs, issues, code, shared notes).

This GitHub organization is used for:
- public discussions and product feedback
- the Decreen public roadmap
- open-source connectors and supporting tools (when applicable)

## Public roadmap

We run a public, problem-focused roadmap in **Discussions**.

Use it to:
- upvote problems that reflect real friction in your work
- comment with concrete examples
- add new topics framed as problems rather than solutions

👉 See: **Discussions → Public Roadmap (Exploring)**

## Questions

For questions about how Decreen works, current behavior, or limitations:
- use **Discussions → Q&A**

This helps keep roadmap discussions focused.

## Repositories

Not all Decreen code is public.

When repositories appear here, they will typically be:
- connectors
- examples
- utilities

Each repository documents its scope.
